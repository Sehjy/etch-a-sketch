- Project Description
  This is a pixel version of the classis etch a sketch everyone had as a kid. User can determine the amount of pixels (default is 4x4) they want on their sketch board and can then use the mouse to hover over any pixel to "sketch" on it. User will be able to pick whatever color they want to use for their hover paint brush. Default is black. User can clear the board at any time. Pixels can be repainted over without restarting. Changing paintbrush color does not reset the board.
